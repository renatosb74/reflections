When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
R: When I need to keep my work safe and controlled by GitHub

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
R: Because I might have someone else working on my project and things may get out of control.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
R: Fork copies repositories on GitHub; clone copies a repository to your local environment; branch is a project version. Based on my needs.
